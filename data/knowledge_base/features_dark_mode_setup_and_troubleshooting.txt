Dark mode is available on Pro and Enterprise plans. To enable: Go to Settings > Appearance > Theme. Options: Light, Dark, System Default. Known issue: 'System Default' may not correctly detect OS dark mode on all platforms. If 'System Default' doesn't work, manually select 'Dark'. This is a known bug being tracked. Scheduled dark mode (auto-switch) is not yet available but is on our feature roadmap for Q3.
