Pending charges are temporary authorization holds placed by your bank. They are NOT actual charges. Authorization holds are released automatically within 3-5 business days. If you need an immediate release, contact your bank directly. For actual refunds of completed transactions, contact our billing team and allow 5-10 business days for processing.
