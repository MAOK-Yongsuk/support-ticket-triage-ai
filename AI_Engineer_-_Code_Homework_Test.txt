AI Engineer - Code Homework Test
Time: 150 - 240 minutes recommended.

●	Please use GPT OpenAI model, DON’T need to provide API KEY. We will use our own key.
●	Provide the source code in a GitHub repository. If you cannot push to Github you can zip the source code file with .git
●	Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application.
●	We advise spending at least 150 - 240 minutes on the test – if you want to spend more or less time on it, that’s completely up to you.
Our scoring will be determined in 4 criterias:
●	Readability
●	Maintainability
●	Extensibility
●	Logic

The Assignment: "Support Ticket Triage Agent"
Scenario
Build an AI agent that triages incoming customer support tickets. The agent should:
1.	Classify ticket urgency (critical/high/medium/low)
2.	Extract key information (product, issue type, customer sentiment)
3.	Search a knowledge base — find relevant FAQ/docs to help answer
4.	Decide next action: auto-respond, route to specialist, or escalate to human
5.	Use at least 2 tools (e.g., check customer history, lookup knowledge base)
What to deliver
1.	Don’t need to build a Chat UI on it, it can be a terminal console or API.
2.	Working code — Agent that processes sample tickets
3.	System prompt — The instructions driving the agent
4.	Tool definitions — Schema + implementation (can be mocked)
5.	Brief write-up (1 page max):
○	Architecture decisions and why
○	What could go wrong and how you'd handle it
○	How you'd evaluate this agent in production
Sample tickets provided

1) Customer info: Free plan (upgrade attempted), 4 months on free tier, first time contacting support
Message 1 (3 hours ago):
"My payment failed when I tried to upgrade to Pro. Can you check what's wrong?"

Message 2 (2 hours ago):
"I tried again with a different card. Now I see TWO pending charges but my account still shows Free plan??"

Message 3 (1 hour ago):
"Okay this is getting ridiculous. Just checked my bank app - I have THREE charges of $29.99 now. None of them refunded. And I STILL don't have Pro access."

Message 4 (just now):
"HELLO?? Is anyone there??? I need this fixed NOW. I have a presentation in 2 hours and I need the Pro export features. If these charges aren't reversed by end of day I'm disputing all of them with my bank."

2) Customer info: Enterprise plan, Thailand region, 45 seats, 8 months customer, first critical issue
Message 1 (2 hours ago):
"ระบบเข้าไม่ได้ครับ ขึ้น error 500"
(Thai: Can't access the system, showing error 500)

Message 2 (1.5 hours ago):
"ลองหลายเครื่องแล้ว ทั้ง Chrome, Safari, Firefox ผลเหมือนกันหมด เพื่อนร่วมงานก็เข้าไม่ได้เหมือนกัน"
(Thai: Tried multiple machines - Chrome, Safari, Firefox - same result. Coworkers also can't access)

Message 3 (45 mins ago):
"ตอนนี้ลูกค้าโวยเข้ามาเยอะมาก เรามี demo กับลูกค้ารายใหญ่บ่ายนี้ ถ้าระบบไม่กลับมา deal นี้อาจจะหลุด"
(Thai: Customers are flooding in with complaints now. We have a demo with a major client this afternoon. If the system doesn't come back, we might lose this deal)

Message 4 (just now):
"เช็ค status.company.com แล้ว บอกว่า all systems operational แต่เราใช้งานไม่ได้จริงๆ ช่วยเช็คให้หน่อยได้ไหมครับ region Asia มีปัญหาหรือเปล่า?"
(Thai: Checked status.company.com - it says all systems operational, but we really can't use it. Can you please check? Is there an issue with the Asia region?)

3) Customer info: Pro plan, 5 months customer, active user (daily logins), no previous support tickets
Message 1 (2 days ago):
"Hey, just wondering if you support dark mode? No rush 😊"

Message 2 (1 day ago):
"Thanks for the reply! Oh nice, so it's in Settings > Appearance. Found it! But hmm I'm on Pro plan and I only see 'Light' and 'System Default' options. No dark mode toggle?"

Message 3 (1 day ago, 3 hours later):
"Okay so I switched to 'System Default' and my Mac is set to dark mode, but your app still shows light theme. Is this a bug or am I missing something?"

Message 4 (today):
"Also random question while I have you - is there a way to schedule dark mode? Like auto-switch at 6pm? Some apps have that. Would be cool if you guys added it 👀"
